Introduction
============

This package provides a `transmogrifier
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.transmogrifier>`_ source for
blogs that come from `Zine <http://zine.pocoo.org>`_. The package parses
the Atom xml export from Zine and places the blog posts and comments
into the transmogrifier pipeline. The settings from the blog can also be
accessed through transmogrifier annotations.
